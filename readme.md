## Health Insurance Predictor
This project uses 4 different Machine Learning Model : Support Vector Machine (SVM),RandomForestRegressor, GradingBoostingRegressor and XGRegressor
We compare all the 4 models and then use the one that gives us the best prediction.
We have also used streamlit to make a GUI for the final model.
